// To test whether two objects x and y represent the same thing, use the == operator.
// In the rare case where you need to know whether two objects are the exact same object,
// use the identical() function instead.

// If x or y is null, return true if both are null, and false if only one is null.
// Return the result of the method invocation x.==(y).
// > Thatâ€™s right, operators such as == are methods that are invoked on their first operand.
